# areadef
A small tool to graphically help the creation of area definitions in Pytroll. It's WIP and plenty of hardcoded stuff, it needs work before it can be used.

USAGE
1) Download the `index.php`

2) Download the following Javascript libraries and place them in the subdirectory `extentjs`<br/>
   https://jquery.com/<br/>
   http://proj4js.org/<br/>
   https://openlayers.org/<br/>
   
3) Update the imports in the `index.php` accordingly

4) Copy everything to a webserver supporting PHP and access the site. That's it.
